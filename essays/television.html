        The Government of Pakistan established the Television Corporation in
        October 1964. Its aim was to introduce a general purpose of television
        service in the country. The first television station in our country was
        set up at Lahore. Now we have television stations at Quetta, Peshawar,
        Islamabad and Karachi etc. Thus, while sitting in our homes. we can
        watch all kinds of programs which are televised. Many educative and
        informative programs can also be shown on the television which are a
        great help to the students and the masses. Television is especially very
        valuable for developing Countries like Pakistan where a great majority
        of the people are illiterate and live in the villages. The people. can
        be imparted much information and education through the television
        programs. If the people of last century could rise from their graves, it
        is certain, they would be speechless on watching the television.

        members of the family. Many dramas can also be shown on television.
        Through talks delivered by the eminent scholars the people can informed
        about the latest happenings and the current problems. The scientists,
        politicians and social workers can also talk to the people directly
        through the medium of television. Thus, the benefits of television are
        numerous. It is no way wrong to say that television is an important
        means of entertainment, education, communication, information and other
        recreational programs. The cinema, the stage and the club are the
        recognized places for recreation but they become stale and dull after a
        time. A television is such means of entertainment as it never makes us
        feel dull, for we have the whole world before our eyes to see and enjoy.

        Television can also help in removing the social and political evils from
        society. It can highlight the evils of dowry, drinking, gambling. etc.
        and help in the removal. Similarly, the government programs like family
        planning, afforestation, adult education and cleanliness of the cities
        can also be propagated through the medium of television very
        successfully.

        The television has certain abuses also. It affects eyesight provided
        that the viewers may sit at a safe distance. Especially children don't
        care of it and they are affected from the harmful rays of television. If
        a person wastes all his time in watching television, he will become lazy
        and unpractical. Long duration programs on television, like films
        deviate a student's attention from his studies. He becomes idle and day-
        dreamer. The cost electricity is influenced too off course.

        importance cannot be denied. So, it can be concluded that television has
        all the benefits once it is used objectively and not as a chewing gum
