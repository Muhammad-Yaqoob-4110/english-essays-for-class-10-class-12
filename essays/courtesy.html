        Courtesy means showing good behaviour and polite manners. Its source is
        <strong>“kindness”</strong> and <strong>“affection”</strong>. The person
        who shows courtesy is called <strong>“Courteous person”</strong>.

        Courtesy may be set in contrast with <strong>“tyranny”</strong> If
        tyranny is the greatest evil, courtesy is the cardinal virtue of
        society. As tyranny is the root of all “vices”, courtesy is the root of
        all virtues.

        Courtesy is common to all the religions of the world. All religions
        teach and propagate morality and courtesy. It is the foundation stone of
        all social, cultural and political movements.

        People should be urged to better their manners. They should be motivated
        to improve their conduct and behaviour with other people. The prime
        purpose of education should be to make humans courteous, well-mannered
        and polite. We can spread courtesy by writing good books and spreading
        them throughout the world. We can develop courtesy by delivering
        sermons. <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        A courteous person always prays good for others, even for his enemies.
        He keeps his ears away from rumours. He dislikes flattery. He respects
        others and is respected by others. He is kind and polite to everyone.

        Good manners are infectious. They pass from one person to others and

        us and influence the whole society lack of courtesy makes life sad and

        Courtesy is such a great virtue that it can turn the enemies into

        other people. We should also preach courtesy in society.
