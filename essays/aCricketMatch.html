        I happened to see a cricket match last Friday. It was played between Pak
        Fighters Club and Eleven Stars Club. The umpires with the two captains
        entered the ground. The captain of Eleven Stars Club won the toss. He
        decided to bat first.

      <p>
        Both the openers of his team entered the ground with dignity. The
        fielding team also came up running to take their positions in the field.
        The commentary on the match was very exciting. In the beginning the
        match was a bit slow in tempo. It was 25 overs match. In the first ten
        overs the batting team could score only 30 runs for the loss of four
        wickets. In the next 10 overs they lost three wickets more but the score
        was then one hundred one. Last five overs most exciting for they scored
        57 more runs in them. The total reached 158 runs in 25 overs, for the
        loss of nine wickets.

        After the first innings there was a short break of 45 minutes. During it
        the vendors appeared with various eatables. The spectators began
        chatting, eating and drinking tea and cold drinks.

        Soon the match resumed. In the first seven overs the Pak Fighters Club
        easily scored seventy runs without losing any wicket. But the next three
        overs proved to be crucial. They lost four important wickets important
        one after the other. The match was even till the last over in which the
        batting side was only to get nine runs and the bowling side was to take
        only one wicket to win match. Every ball created suspense and excitement
        among the crowd. At last, on one ball only two runs were required. The
        batsman hit a boundary and the Pak Fighters Club Won the match.

        Some excited spectators ran towards the wiring team, some started
        leaving and some kept sitting to see the prize distribution ceremony.

        One thing must be kept in mind that the spirit of games is not to win
        only. Games also teach us to practice patience, tolerance, honesty,
        dignity and other moral values.

        <strong>To conclude,</strong> sports are healthy activity to create a
        healthy society. They are an expression of players' stamina,
        athleticism, sportsman spirit and self-control. Besides, sports are
        great fun for players as well as spectators. This match was evidence of
        such ideals!
