        Aristotle maintains that man is a goal seeking animal. His life becomes
        meaningful only when he struggles for his goals. Many people fail in
        life because they fail to organize their energies and focus on
        something. People, like nails, lose their effectiveness when they lose
        direction and begin to bend.

        determine a particular aim for him. <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        Ambition works as a guiding star, sharpens the abilities and faculties
        of a person. Ambition simply means aim or desire for one’s future. It
        helps as in keeping our attention focused on a particular point.
        <strong>As it is said,</strong> without ambition life would be as.

        Different people have aims. Most of them want to become doctor,
        engineer, pilots, officers and Industrialists. It is because these are
        paying professions. As far as, my aim is concerned. I want to do master
        in “Information Technology”. A great revolution has been brought by
        Information Technology fields of life. It has modernized our life and
        changed our attitude. <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        First of all, it is the need of the hour. It is the most popular and
        emerging branch of contemporary knowledge. After the
        <strong>11th September 2001</strong>, catastrophe of
        <strong>USA</strong>, Islam has become the most widely discussed Issue
        throughout world.

        Anti- Islamic propaganda campaign is flourishing through various media
        being a Muslim, it is my duty to defend my religion. This I can do
        effectively and forcefully by Information Technology. This will help me
        in preaching my religion and removing mis- concept about it. It will
        also become a source of my cardinal and spiritual satisfaction. I have
        chosen this profession only keeping in view the serious and sensitive
        nature of this issue. By adopting this profession, I would be able to
        refute all charges falsely levelled against “Islam” Beside this I would
        be able to attract the non- Muslims towards Islam through internet and
        E-mails. <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        My philosophy of life is that we should set our goal and then we should
        try hard to achieve it. In the final analysis, I must say that aims and
        ambitions are very important to determine a career or profession for us.
        I am ready to perform any sacrifice for it. I am determined to leave no
        stone unturned to achieve my aim in life.
