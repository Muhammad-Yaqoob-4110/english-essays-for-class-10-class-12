        There is a sensation and delight not only in playing games but also in
        witnessing them. We can see the spectators absorbed in the matches. The
        people can enjoy the games and forget the worries of their life. The
        beginners can learn the art of games when they examine the performance
        of the professionals. There goes a good <strong>proverb</strong>,

        Games and sports include all indoor and outdoor games and also
        athletics. In ancient Greek, they formed the principal part of
        education. In the advanced countries of the present day, also they are a
        regular feature of school and college curriculum.

        The great virtue that sports teach is to acquire the will to win. If
        anyone knows how to acquire the will to win, he will succeed in every
        aspect of life. The willing power of the sportsman is increased by
        winning the game. Comparatively, a weak-willed man resigns himself after
        defeat but a true sportsman who is defeated must strengthen his nerve.
        Because he knows:

        I was delighted to witness a hockey match between Pakistan and Germany
        at the Pakistan Stadium recently. The players of both teams showed their
        qualities of strength, stamina, agility and mobility.
        <strong>As it is Said:</strong>

        The Germans dominated in the beginning but our players fought back and
        coordinated remarkably. The Germans made strong attempts but goalkeeper
        made spectacular saves. The match was suspended briefly when home crowd
        fired crackers which cause dense clouds of smoke all around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pakistani forwards kept the Possession and played like a team. The
        only weakness however, was in the penalty corners. The team played with
        full devotion. Pakistan opened its attacks mostly from the flanks but
        the speed and timely interception of the Germans attackers saved them.
        <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        Our left half took the ball from the German attackers and after running
        up a few paces sent in through pass to inside left. He dispatched the
        ball towards the goal with a flick. Another Pakistani player who was
        closely following him, tapped the ball to score the goal. At last, the
        time was up and our team came out happy and victorious. They had won the
        match by one goal. We clapped and shouted with joy. Our players had not
        let us down. The crowd went wild with joy at the victory of Pakistan.
