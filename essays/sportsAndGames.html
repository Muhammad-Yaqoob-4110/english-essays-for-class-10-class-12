        The Greeks were the first nation who introduced the marathon race and
        told the ways how to shape the body through exercise and sports. They

        In past, sports were regarded as outdoor recreational pastimes. Such as
        fishing, hunting and shooting. On the other hand, games were the
        organized contests played by individuals or the teams. But distinction
        between these two terms disappeared with the passage often of time. Now
        both terms are often used interchangeably. Games are common to all
        countries and cultures. <strong>As it is said,</strong>

        Some bookworms give no importance to sports. They are always absorbed in

        The youth of today want to assert themselves. They want some outlet to
        present their unrivalled faculties. Sports and games provide them with
        plenty of such opportunities. If these chances are not given to them,
        they may fall a prey to criminal activities. So, indirectly sports
        contribute a lot towards making our youth decent and upright. As a
        result, undertake beneficial pursuits. <strong>As it is said,</strong>

        Players obey the order of their captain and the umpire without any

        Games also teach us discipline. People learn to obey and uphold laws.
        Games promote team spirit in players. They keep them united. They forget
        their tiny differences and fight for a common cause. They learn to co-
        operate. They show an infinite patience in their doings. But!

        There is a dark side of this picture also. Games may cause certain harms
        sometimes the players do ignore the rules of decency for their own
        victory. They aim to win by hook or crook. They practice illegal and
        immoral tricks to this end. Second, too much interest may spoil some
        intelligent students. They may ignore their studies to become good
        athletes. In this way, they become neither good students nor good
        athletes. But,

        One thing must be kept in mind that the spirit of games is not to win

        Sports are very interesting pastime. They should be organized that they
        will not interfere with studies of our youth. Life is not all sports;
        sports should be an only a part of it.

        To conclude, sports are healthy activity to create a healthy society.
        They are an expression of players' stamina, athleticism, sportsman
        spirit and self-control. Besides, sports are great fun for players as
        well as spectators.
