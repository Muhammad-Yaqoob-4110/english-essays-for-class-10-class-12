        House is the most fundamental and radical need of life. It gives human a
        sense of safety and security. It makes life easy, comfortable and
        enjoyable. No animate thing can live without house birds and animals
        also make their shelters. Birds may fly whole the day but come back to
        their nests. Animals may roam whole the day in search grazing but come
        back to their rest places. Honey bees have honey combs. Snakes and even
        ants have their holes. Every living thing has an innate desire for an
        abode. <strong>It is said,</strong>

        My house is situated on the bank of a big canal is incredibly splendid
        huge shady trees are surrounding the white building of my house. Its
        environment is quiet and calm. It stands away from the hue and cry of
        city life. Its building is wonderfully clean and spacious.

        A green front lawn and back garden of my house are particularly
        beautiful. The thick green “mistletoe” covering the front wall of my
        house enhances the beauty of my house. The soft, tidy and trimmed grass
        of the front lawn looks like the green velvety floor. In the back garden
        of my house. There is mango, lemon, orange and banana trees. They bear
        plentiful fruits. Their bloom flowers of many colors in the front lawn.
        Their fragrance spreads all around. In evening I sit in my garden. The
        fragrance of flowers refreshens my mind. In morning dew drops on the
        grass look like pearls. I feel very happy while sitting in my lawn.
