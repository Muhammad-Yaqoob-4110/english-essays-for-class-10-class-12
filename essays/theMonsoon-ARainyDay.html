        Rain is a great blessing for mankind. Monsoon is the wind that changes
        direction with the change of season. The monsoon prevails mainly in the
        Indian Ocean. The summer monsoon blows from southwest, generally from
        April to October It blows from Ocean to land. The summer monsoon usually
        causes heavy rainfall in the areas of the East Indies, India and
        Pakistan. It is the dominant climate event of the area. The pouring rain
        continues with the summer monsoon. It is called the rainy season in this
        area.

        Pakistan is an agricultural country and prosperity of our country so;
        farmers greatly depend on rain. If rains are sufficient then we have
        good agricultural crops and if they are scantily then famine occurs in
        many parts of country. On the other hand, if there are rains than
        needed, they bring ruination for the people. Thus, we can say that rains
        are both blessing and a curse for our countrymen.

        In the summer season, when it is very hot the people pray for rains so
        that they can get relief from scorching heat of the sun. At such times
        when the clouds appear on the sky everybody becomes happy.

        Last Sunday was probably the hottest day of this summer. The summer
        moved like a flame upon plains and meadows. Suddenly, the gusts of
        monsoon came like a sudden surge of grace. The sky was overcast with
        dark and silvery clouds. A cool refreshing wind began to fan everywhere.
        The thunder and lightning were accompanied with heavy rain.

        The joy of people knew no bounds. It must have rained for three hours.
        All the streets were flooded. It looked as if there was water and water
        everywhere. There was knee deep water on certain roads and low-lying
        areas in the city. The traffic on these roads had been closed for some
        time. <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        When the rain stopped, ultimately the people started moving. The traffic
        which was standing still now started moving on the roads. The people who
        had taken shelter under the roofs of shops and buildings now started
        moving towards their destination. Rain made all the people happy as they
        had got rid of scorching heat of summer. Thus, rain is a true blessing.

        Of course, the rain also brought misery to certain people. Many huts in
        the low-lying slums were washed away. Many houses collapsed due
        continuous rains. The roofs of many old houses started leaking. The
        streets and the roads had become slippery. Thus, people had to face much
        trouble. No doubt the trees looked as if they were washed by nature. The
        whole surrounding looked green and pleasant. The farmers were also very
        happy as they hoped to have good crops now. Even the animals and the
        birds were full of joy and mirth. <strong>As it is said:</strong>
