        There is hardly any living being who has not gone through ups and downs
        of life. Actually, life is full of bad as well as good incidents. Some
        of them may be forgotten, whereas others leave an ever-lasting imprint
        on the mind.

        <strong>Helen Keller</strong>, the dumb and deaf American authoress,
        holds that we do not value the things until we lose them. Her words
        echoed in my mind on my last day at college. It was only then I realized
        how much I cherished the school I was going to leave. It seemed to me as
        if somebody were drawing my soul out from my body.

        School is a sacred place. It educates the young people. It is the place
        where concrete foundations of a nation are laid down apparently. It
        imparts education, but secretly it grooms the young generation. For life
        and its weighty responsibilities. Students spend a substantial part of
        their lives in their schools. <strong>As it is said,</strong>

        Students develop an emotional association with their schools. Moreover,
        in schools’ students live like a family So, it is difficult for them, to
        separate from each other. But a day comes, when they have to desert the
        school and all its charms. It is the time of real sadness for them. But
        they pass this ordeal with great patience.

        In the store house of my memories, my last day at school occupies a
        prominent position. I cannot forget the day when left the school. School
        is a place where we spend ten golden years of our life. Those happy
        days, the lectures and the punishment on loosing test still haunt my
        memories. School is a place where we form many associations.

        I also remember my last day school. It was a pleasant day of
        <strong>"3rd March"</strong>
        But it was a gloomy day for me and my class mates.
      </p>
      <p>
        My friends and I were aware of the grim reality that we were about to
        leave the school forever. Throughout, our stay we had been so excited
        and cheerful. We never entertained that a day would come to separate us
        were so emotional that they could not 2 control themselves and started
        weeping. Some had tears in their eyes, but they controlled themselves.

        We decided to depart in the same joyful mood, we had been there for last
        ten years. First of all, we planned to meet our teachers. We obtained
        their autographs in our diaries. Then, we had a round of school to see
        every nook and corner of it. I went to my own class. My mind flew back
        about the noisy classes. School canteen was full of life as usual. Then,
        I walked to library. I had a look on the countless books which I could
        not read. I had tears in my eyes and I remembered these lines:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">“Tears from depth of some divine despair,</p>

        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">Rise in the heart and gather to eyes.</p>

        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">In looking on happy autumn fields</p>
        </strong>
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">And thinking of the days that are no more.”</p>

        Then we met our headmaster/ headmistress who gave character
        certificates. He advised us to be honest and hardworking in life and
        wished a continued success for our future. He/ She also advised us that,

        In the evening, we got ready to go our homes. It was the time to say
        goodbye to each other. We embraced each other for the last time. Some of
        us could not control themselves and began to weep bitterly. Finally, we
        departed with the hope that we would meet again someday, somewhere. This
        is how I spent my last day at school.
