        It is a good and famous proverb we heard from our elders. Health is a
        great blessing of Allah upon us. We can adopt many devices to maintain
        our health. <strong>It is said:</strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">
            “Half the spiritual difficulties that men and women suffer arise
            from the morbid state of health.”
          </p>
        </strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Health is a mental and physical well-being. It is a gift of Allah. A
        healthy man enjoys the beauties of nature. He leads a happy and
        delightful life. Nothing can rejoice or relax an ailing man. Such a man
        loses all the charms of life. Life becomes dull, drab and dreary for
        him. He himself becomes an unbearable burden on others. Sometimes, he
        desires to die to avoid the pangs of such a painful life. Therefore,
        nothing is more precious than health. <strong>It is said:</strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">
            “The feeling of health can only be gained by sickness.”

      <p>
        The importance of good health can be known by illness. Health is a
        divine blessing. Sick people cannot do anything of their own taste. They
        have to depend on others. Rest is also very important for health.

        But a healthy person can do anything of his own wish and desire.
        Therefore, man should pay an utmost heed to health.

        For this purpose, man should live in the environment conductive to
        health. He should take nutritious food. Because,

      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">

        Good food, calm atmosphere, fresh air, pure water, regular physical
        exercise and better sanitary conditions are bare essential health.
      </p>
      <p>
        First balanced diet is absolutely necessary for health. Human beings
        require food to grow, reproduce and maintain health. Without food, our
        bodies cannot stay warm. They cannot build or repair tissues. Good food
        helps us to prevent certain diseases or recover fast from illness. Our
        food contains certain chemicals substances called
        <strong>“nutrients.”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These nutrients help our body to perform its important functions. They
        are classified as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and
        water. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats provide the body with the energy
        it needs to be perform its functions. We should get up early in the
        morning. <strong>It is said:</strong>

        Second, regular physical exercise makes a man healthy, fit, active,

        Therefore, it is our duty to keep us healthy. Drinking and smoking are
        the bad habits that are even fatal. Young people have plenty of energy.
        They should take part in physical activities. Moreover, another big
        source of health is <strong>“cleanliness”.</strong> Because, it saves us
        from many diseases.

        For this purpose, we should take a bath daily. We should keep our body

        Health is very important for students because only a heathy student can
        take an active part in activities of life. Some bookworms pay no heed to
        their mental and physical fitness. They are always absorbed in their
        studies ultimately; they lose their mental and physical fitness. They
        should know that there is no substitution to health.

        The improvement of health of entire population is first and foremost

        Government should provide the people with better health facilities, good
        food and calm atmosphere should be ensured. Government should educate
        the people about health. It should provide the people with high quality
        health Services. One thing must be kept in mind that nothing is more
        precious than health. So, everyone should lead a happy and healthy life.
