        These flowers show different colors. They give off sweet smell and

        I feel happy when I hear the songs of the birds sitting in the branches
        of these trees. A fountain plays in the middle of this garden. The green
        grass of the lawn also looks beautiful. When I walk on the grass wet
        with dew drops, I feel fresh and happy. The dew drops sparkling in the
        sunshine look like pearls. <strong>It is said:</strong>

        Gardening provides me a good exercise for the day. It keeps me healthy,
        fresh and happy for labour of the day. Gardening is my sincere friend;
        it inspires me whenever I am in depressed mood. I cast a glance on my
        garden and my blossoms.

        I daily devote some of my time for the maintenance of my garden. I dig
        the beds of flowers, trim the grass and apply manure to the plants.
        Sometime, I spray plants and prune the flowers. I love to work and sit
        in my garden and lawn. <strong>It is rightly said:</strong>

        actively in plantation scheme of the government every year. I have
