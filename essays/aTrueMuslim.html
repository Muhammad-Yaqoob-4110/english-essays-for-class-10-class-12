        He has firm faith in Allah, His Prophets, angels, books and the day of
        resurrection. He also believes in good or bad fate. After having this
        firm faith, he says prayers five times a day. He pays “zakat and
        performs “Hajj”. He fasts during the whole month of ‘Ramazan’. The life
        of a true Muslim reflects true spirit of Islam. He never violates the
        golden principles of Islam. <strong>As it is said,</strong>

        His dealings and conduct with people are always exemplary. He holds a
        high standard of morality A true Muslim is not a wealth seeker. He is
        contented with what he earns from his noble labour. The wealth of the
        whole world cannot give him peace and contentment. His peace and
        contentment lie in bowing before Allah.

        He never feels hesitant in adopting and using modern technologies. In
        short, to be a good Muslim is true, a great blessing of Allah. A true
        Muslim possesses all positive and constructive qualities. He is
        beneficial and useful to his family, society and country. But in doing
        all this he never ignores the spirit of Islam.
