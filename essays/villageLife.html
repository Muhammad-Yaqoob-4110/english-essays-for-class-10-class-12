        Village life is the scenery of the changing seasons and divine beauty.
        It also depicts the moral and cultural values of a state or a province
        in their true colours and aspects.

        Man is a social animal. He cannot live alone. Therefore, he wants to
        live with his fellowmen. So, he forms communities, villages, towns,
        cities, and countries. A village is a small unit. In village, we can
        observe nature more closely. A poet presents his thoughts about village
        in the following words. <strong>Sweet Album</strong>

        village is a small town situated in a country area. It consists of a few
        small huts and mud houses. These houses are built all over the area
        without any order. It is the surrounding greenery of the village that
        makes its wonderful. The tall trees, green fields, murming streams,
        flowery bushes and calm nature add to the beauty of village.

        There is no special fun for the villagers. There only hobby is to make
        gossips and watch TV in the evening. Their marriage ceremony is the most
        amusing event of the village. This is the occasion when the villagers
        show their feelings of joy and pleasure
        <strong>“Village fair”</strong> is still another event of amusement for
        the them.

        There are many benefits of village life. First, life in a village is an
        easy and pure. The needs of the villagers are a few. Eggs, milk,
        vegetables and butter are their common diet. Their diet is pure though
        it is simple. Their dresses, food, customs and manners are simple but
        decent.

        I cannot even envisage of walking in the roads in the city because there
        is so much noise of people and the cars honk incessantly. The living
        experience in the village is worthy of claim. There is a lot peace
        village life is about purity.

        Second, the villagers are sincere and honest. They know no selfishness.
        They love their customs and traditions. They are simple, honest,
        innocent, kind and hospitable. There are also some disadvantages of
        village life. It lacks modern facilities. The hospitals and education
        are limited there. Most of the people in villages are ignorant. Due to
        their ignorance, they face many problems.

        The villagers are content with their lot. They do not have high
        ambitions. Their only interest is how to increase the yield of crops.
        Villagers are very simple. They do not know any tactics and selfishness.
        They live for others.

        In Pakistan more than 60% of the population lives in rural areas.
        Moreover, in our economy village plays a very dominant role in
        contribution to

        >, food supply of raw materials to industries. Hence, the government
        should spread Mass education by establishing schools and colleges. Roads
        and other means of communication should be improved. Villages should be
        electrified. Rural banking should be setup for financial assistance to
        the village people. If these steps are taken, the villagers would play
        their role in the development of the country.

        In short, it is true that country life is sweet one. Many poets have
        sung the praise of it. Great men and thinkers have spent their
        invaluable lives in the country side. Hence, village life has been
        cherished highly, in all ages by every soulful man.
