        The word library comes from the Latin word "liber", meaning book. A
        library is, as everyone knows, a room or building in which a
        well-arranged collection of books, CDs, newspapers, gramophone records,
        etc. is kept for reading or reference. A library is a shed of knowledge.
        It is a proper place where everyone can find some books that are full of
        knowledge. This is an age of progress in education. Great importance is
        attached to the libraries as they play a vital role in promoting
        literacy and education.

        broader. A person of a single book belongs to none. More reading makes
        mindsets mature and peace loving. Books are message of peace. They are
        the most loyal and sincere friends. The world spread upon pages is
        reflection of the real world. <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        Libraries are particularly essential in educational institutions. Every
        school, college or a university must have a markable library. Students
        use to go to library for reading books and to research different topics
        and fields. Libraries enhance the class experiences of the students.
        They induce both academic and co-curricular factors.

        They introduce good habits of reading in students. Public officials also
        use libraries to sort social and official complexities. People of every
        field are linked to libraries. But it is a fact that no library has all
        the information and knowledge. So, different libraries should be set up
        at different scales. Libraries from an interaction between people of
        different fields and generations.

        are public libraries. They serve the general members of public. Second,

        libraries. They meet the needs of advanced scholars. Fifth, there are

        governmental agencies. Sixth, there are government libraries. They serve
        governmental departments and agencies. Libraries play an important role
