        The train drawn by the heavy engine would stop briefly for the
        passengers at places called railway stations. The British invented the
        railway and locomotive. The train-track was laid for the trains to
        connect different towns and villages on the route. People come to the
        railway station to leave their dears but some people come to receive
        their dears. The people who leave their dears become sad and who receive
        their dears they become happy. Therefore,

        Last Sunday, I went to the railway station with my father. He has a job
        there. I saw typical scenes there. The smart uniformed station master
        and his staff hurriedly move about when some train is due in or out. The
        platform is thronged with passengers, men, women and children. Some stay
        close to their piles of luggage other just walk about looking at
        colorful ads. The vendors do roaring business. Their brightly lit stalls
        or barrows at different points attract the passenger’s. There is a noise
        and clamor all around.

        Meals, fruits. Gol gappa’s, pakoras, books, magazines, souvenirs and
        Knick- knacks sell like hot cakes. In summer, pitchers and fans are in
        great demand. Watercoolers and taps are the busiest spots. There was
        great crowd.

        As soon as the announcement about the approaching train is made, a
        frantic activity emerges at the station. People rush towards the ticket
        room. The passengers sitting in the waiting room take their luggage’s
        and come out. Some begin to stare in the direction of the arriving
        train. At last, the whistle of the train is heard. The train looks
        graceful when it enters the station. As soon as it stops, people emerge
        from the interior of the train. Those who are out, try to get on the
        train to оссuру the seats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some are seen to be dragging their suitcases and bags. There is a great
        hustle and bustle on the platform. Some passengers rush to the tea
        stalls. Some are seen carry their luggage and seen buying eatables. Some
        rush to the water coolers to fill their water bottles and containers
        with cool water. The vendors shout slogans to attract the attention of
        the passengers to their things.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few policemen roaming about on the platform. A few ticket
        checkers dressed in white uniforms also come into view. Some passengers
        are seen requesting ticket checkers for the booking of the seats. There
        are other people who have come either to receive their friends or see
        them off. They are seen to be embracing each other. Then suddenly, the
        train whistles. The guard begins to wave green banner. The passengers
        rush towards their compartments. The train begins to creep slowly.
        People begin to run with the creeping train. They try to get on the
        running train. Those who have come to see off their dear ones stand on
        the platform and wave their hands. Their faces are sad and depressed. As
        soon as train disappears, they begin to leave the station. Soon, all the
        activity which started so rapidly a little while ago end so suddenly.
        The station is deserted a last.
