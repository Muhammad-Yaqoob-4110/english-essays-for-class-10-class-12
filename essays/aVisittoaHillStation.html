        Recreational trips and tours are part and parcel of life. They enhance
        our knowledge and experience. They provide us with pleasure and joy.
        They refresh our minds. They add to our understanding.

        It is a great pleasure to visit a hill station in summer. It was a
        pleasant day of summer when we proceeded to Murree. During the journey
        to the Murree hills, we enjoyed the beautiful scenes all around. There
        were tall green trees growing along the road on the slopes of hills. The
        clouds were playing hide seek with the mountain peaks. Soon it began
        drizzling.

      <p>
        It was a pleasant and memorable journey. Reaching Murree, we stayed in a
        hotel. First of all, we took a bath, enjoyed lunch and took Some rest.
        In the evening, we got ready to see the beautiful hills of Murree. It
        was really a beautiful sight. The cool breeze was fanning our faces and
        refreshing our minds.

        We climbed the mountains and ran wildly all over the hill. It was nearly
        getting dark when we returned. A gentle shower of rain began to fall. We
        hurried back and reached our hotel. Then we changed our dresses as it
        had been quite cold and wet due to rain. The night was cold I had to
        cover myself with a blanket Throughout the night it continued raining
        but it was dawning the rain stopped. We were glad to see this sudden
        change of weather.

        We planned to visit <strong>Patriata</strong>. After an hour's journey,
        we reached there. We bought tickets for cable car. It was novel
        experience for us. It was an amazing experience to look dawn from the
        cable car. The view beneath simply seemed to be a fairyland. At last, we
        reached Patriata Hills. We stayed there till 5 p.m. We rode on horses
        and drank tea. We also enjoyed а delicious lunch. After this we took
        some photographs of the beautiful scenes. On our way back to Murree we
        stayed for some time in the Wonderland Park. We reached Murree at night.

        The next day we visited adjacent valleys. We went out to see the
        Sanitorium down in the valley. There were thick forests of pine trees
        and the entire area was green and charming. There are also many fruit
        gardens on the slopes. On our way back we crossed two fast-flowing
        streams. The water of these streams was very cold and clean. The number
        of glowing colors looked as much beautiful as:

        We stayed there for three days. Then we returned to our city. We had a
        lot of golden memories of this memorable trip. Our photographs would
        keep this trip ever fresh in our minds. We gained a lot of knowledge,
        experience from recreation and experience from this trip.
