        great who is great only his lifetime. The of greatness is the page of
        history. History is replete with noble and sacred aim of life was to
        help and guide their fellow men. We read and recall commemorate and
        command the names of great scientists, artists, politicians, poet’s
        sages whose tireless and selfless efforts brought comfort and peace to
        the suffering humanity. They died but their death makes them immortal
        because they live in our hearts.

        <strong>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong> was a unique leader of
        Indian Muslims. He offered Muslims an unprecedented leadership. No one
        before or after him practiced politics as he did. Allah has treasured up
        all the supreme qualities of a great leader in him. When the Muslims of
        sub-continent made up their minds for emancipation, they turned their
        eyes on Quaid-e-Azam who cut off the fetters of slavery and brought his
        people the gift of freedom. He had qualities of a great hero by all
        standards. In other words:

        Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born in Karachi on December 25th, 1876. He got
        his early education in a local Maktab. He was a very intelligent
        student. Then he got admission in Missionary High School. After that he
        made towards England for Bar-at-Law. When he was in England, Muslims
        besought him to come to India and let Indian Muslims through the fire
        and water to their destination. The Muslims were placed between fires;
        The English and the Hindus. It was the Quaid who freed them from dual
        slavery.

        He worked as a member of Indian National Congress. He wanted to unite
        Hindus and Muslims against English so that India could win freedom. But
        soon he realized that Hindus were trying to safeguard their own
        interest, negating the interest of the Muslims. So, he joined Muslim
        League to fight for the rights of the Muslims. Mr. Jinnah also fought
        for the rights of the Muslims.

        Quaid-e-Azam devoted his life to Muslims. His leadership kindled a new
        imagination among the frustrated Muslims. He created political
        consciousness among the Muslims of India. It was due to his leadership
        that Muslims regained their confidence. Each and every Muslim responded
        to clarion call and they, with one Voice demanded for them.

        This sharp minded, hawk eyed, unflinching and unyielding man worked day
        and night for Pakistan. It was due to his leadership that the British
        could not weld the Hindus and the Muslims into one unity. Ultimately, he
        was able to carve out Pakistan on the map of the world. The dream
        Pakistan became reality on <strong>14 August, 1947</strong> 1947.
        Quaid-e-Azam became the first Governor General of Pakistan.

        Quaid-e-Azam was against all social evils. He wanted to see Pakistan a
        peaceful, powerful and prosperous Country. He died on
        <strong>11th September, 1948</strong>. But his courage, hard work
        fearlessness, oratory and his services for Muslims will keep him alive
        in our hearts.

        Quaid-e-Azam was a dynamic leader. Quaid-e-Azam will always live in the
        hearts of the Pakistanis as the father of the nation. His words,
        <strong>"Faith, Unity and Discipline"</strong> will always inspire the
        people in their struggle for nation- building.
