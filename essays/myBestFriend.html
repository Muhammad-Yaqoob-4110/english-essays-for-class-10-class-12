        In our lives, we come across many people. We see new faces every day.
        Friends come and go. throughout our life. People today have become so
        selfish that it becomes difficult to regard anybody as your best friend.
        People whom you regard as your best friends often prove otherwise.

        A friend is an invaluable asset. They enhance our happiness and soothe
        our sorrows. They stand by us through thick and thin.
        <strong>As it is said:</strong>

        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">

        They are a source joy and pleasure for us. We can share our joy and
        sorrow with them. <strong>Bacon says:</strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">
            “No one can live without friend, except beast or a God.”

      <p>Moreover, he says:</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">
            “A person who has no friend eats up his own heart.”
          </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        A person who has no friend feels alone. He always remains sad. A friend
        is a precious diamond. A person who has no friend is poor.
        <strong>As the Holy Quran says:</strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">“He who has no friend is poor.”</p>
        </strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        A person who has no friend cannot share his joys and sorrows with
        others. Therefore, to have a false friend is better than to have no
        friend.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-3">
        <strong>
          <p class="mb-0">
